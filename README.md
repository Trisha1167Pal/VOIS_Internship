# VOIS_Internship
In my Python project, Iâ€™ve implemented steganography, an artful technique for hiding secret data within ordinary images. Using the least significant bit (LSB) method, I encode messages into pixel values, making them imperceptible to the eye. This project report provides an overview of image steganography, its applications, and various techniques.
